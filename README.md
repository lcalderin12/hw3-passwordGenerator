# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

The password generator in this assignment is composed of html, css and lots of javascript. Various arrays like "number" or "lowerCase" were created. We declared varibles, such as "length" and "lower." The arrays and declarations will be consolidated using a  couple of functions such as "if statements" and "Math.random." "While" loops were used instad of "if" "else" to shortened the code. Alerts are displayed to show user choices. A functional button was added to inititate the generator.
